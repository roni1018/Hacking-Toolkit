For my tool, I chose CrowdStrike which is a cybersecurity firm that was founded in 2011 in Austin, Texas. CrowdStrike works by offering protection solutions to work against and prevent cyber attacks. It also uses the power of AI to detect any possible attacks or intrusions. CrowdStrike is an open source to "give back to the community." As found on their website their purpose is to "protect customers against today's adversaries and stop breaches." CrowdStrike is not free, it offers a 15-day free trial then the basic subscription pricing begins at $59.99/year. A fun fact about the company that I found is that the current CEO used to be the Chief Technology Officer at McAfee.
